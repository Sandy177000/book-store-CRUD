# Book-store-CRUD
A simple web app to practice CRUD operations using Spring boot and mySQL.

In the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations of the book store web app built with Spring Boot and MySQL, the system seamlessly manages book data.

Create (C):

User can add new books to the inventory by providing details like title, author, price.
A form captures the necessary information, and upon submission, the data is stored in the MySQL database.

Read (R):

Users can browse the book catalog in available books section.
The app retrieves book details from the MySQL database, displaying them on the user interface.

Update (U):

User can modify book information such as title, author, or quantity in response to changes or corrections.
The app updates the corresponding records in the MySQL database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

Delete (D):

User can remove books.
Upon deletion, the app updates the MySQL database, reflecting the removal of the selected book.
The Spring Boot framework facilitates rapid development with its conventions, while MySQL ensures data integrity and persistence. 
Together, they create a robust foundation for a responsive and efficient book store web app that supports essential CRUD functionalities.
